This repository contains a React Native project generated in a collaboration with chatGPT. This is effictively an artifact of following the Packt Publishing course, 'The Ultimate ChatGPT Guide with React Native - Develop Mobile Apps'. The course demonstrates techniques for finding efficiencies with generative AI in a software engineering context.

The project started by asking chatGPT the following question:
> Please provide the detailed steps required to build a mobile application from scratch including the most popular libraries, in a development environment with good developer ergonomics. The application should be written in a leading javascript library. The application should be an instagram clone that can display stories, profiles and story

Here is chatGPT's response:

To build a mobile application from scratch, you will need to follow these steps:

Choose your development environment: You will need to choose a development environment that is well-suited for building mobile applications. Some of the popular options include React Native, Ionic, and Flutter. React Native is a good choice if you want to build a mobile application using a leading javascript library.

Install the necessary software: Depending on the development environment you choose, you will need to install the necessary software on your computer. For example, if you choose React Native, you will need to install Node.js, npm, and the React Native command-line interface (CLI).

Set up your project: Once you have installed the necessary software, you will need to set up your project. This will involve creating a new project folder and initializing it with the necessary files and directories.

Choose your database: You will need to choose a database to store user data. Some popular options include Firebase, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

Create your user interface: You will need to create a user interface for your application. This will involve designing the screens and components that users will interact with.

Implement user authentication: To allow users to sign in and access their profiles, you will need to implement user authentication. You can use a library like Firebase Authentication to handle this.

Implement stories and profiles: Once users are signed in, they should be able to view stories and profiles. You will need to create the necessary screens and components to display this information.

Integrate with the Instagram API: To display stories and profiles, you will need to integrate with the Instagram API. This will involve obtaining an access token and making API requests to retrieve the necessary data.

Test and debug your application: Once you have implemented all the necessary features, you will need to test and debug your application. You can use a tool like the React Native Debugger to help with this.

Deploy your application: Finally, you will need to deploy your application to the App Store or Google Play Store. You can use a service like Expo to simplify the deployment process.

Popular libraries for building mobile applications with React Native include:

React Navigation: A library for creating navigation screens and components.
Redux: A library for managing state in your application.
Axios: A library for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
Styled Components: A library for styling React Native components.
React Native Elements: A library of pre-built UI components for React Native.
Keep in mind that building a mobile application from scratch can be a complex and time-consuming process. It is important to have a good understanding of the development environment and libraries you are using, as well as strong programming skills. It may also be helpful to work with a team of developers or hire a professional mobile app development company to help you build your application.
